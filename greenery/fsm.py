    A Finite State Machine or FSM has an alphabet and a set of states. At
    any given moment, the FSM is in one state. When passed a symbol from
    the alphabet, the FSM jumps to another state (or possibly the same
    state). A map (Python dictionary) indicates where to jump.
    One state is nominated as a starting state. Zero or more states are
    nominated as final states. If, after consuming a string of symbols,
    the FSM is in a final state, then it is said to "accept" the string.
    This class also has some pretty powerful methods which allow FSMs to
    be concatenated, alternated between, multiplied, looped (Kleene star
    closure), intersected, and simplified.
