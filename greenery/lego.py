'''
	LEGO:
	Classes and methods for the creation and manipulation of regular expression
	objects and components.

	* A regular expression is a "pattern" object.
	* Each pattern alternates (with a pipe, "|") between zero or more "conc"
	(concatenation) objects.
	* Each conc is a concatenation of zero or more "mult" (multiplication)
	objects.
	* Each mult consists of a multiplicand and a multiplier. A multiplier consists
	of a minimum and a maximum, e.g. min = 0, max = 1 indicates the "?"
	multiplier. The multiplicand is either a nested pattern object, or a
	charclass object.
	* A charclass is a set of chars, such as "a", "[a-z]", "\\d", ".", with a
	possible "negated" flag as in "[^a]".
	* Since these can be combined together freely they are, in the absence of a
	better metaphor, collectively referred to as lego pieces.

	We also include methods for parsing a string into a pattern object,
	serialising a pattern object out as a string (or "regular expression", if you
	will), and for concatenating or alternating between arbitrary "pieces of
	lego", using overloaded operators.

	If the FSM module is available, call lego.to_fsm() on any lego piece to return
	a finite state machine capable of accepting strings described by that piece.

	Most important are the reduce() methods present in charclass, mult, conc and
	pattern. While there is no such thing as a canonical form for a given regex
	pattern, these procedures can drastically simplify a regex structure for
	readability. They're also pretty extensible.

		containing no possibilities is possible and represents a regular expression
		matching no strings whatsoever (there is no conventional string form for
		this).

		e.g. "abc|def(ghi|jkl)" is an alt containing two concs: "abc" and
		"def(ghi|jkl)". The latter is a conc containing four mults: "d", "e", "f"
		and "(ghi|jkl)". The latter in turn is a mult consisting of an upper bound
		1, a lower bound 1, and a multiplicand which is a new subpattern, "ghi|jkl".
		This new subpattern again consists of two concs: "ghi" and "jkl".
